Example Answer: *markup language*

1. False

2. (1) The opening tag, (2) the closing tag, (3) the content, and (4) the element.

3. Nesting

4. Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — they will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line. Block-level elements tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element. Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts of the document’s content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content. An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside a paragraph of text, for example an `<a>` element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as `<em>` or `<strong>`.

5. The `<img>` element
